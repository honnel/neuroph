 * Neuron's input function. It has two subcomponents:
 * 
 * weightsFunction - which performs operation with input and weight vector
 * summingFunction - which performs operation with the resulting vector from weightsFunction
 * 
 * InputFunction implements the following behaviour:
 * output = summingFunction(weightsFunction(inputs))
 * 
 * Different neuron input functions can be created by setting different weights and summing functions.
